	abstract = {Evaluating the faulty behaviour of low-cost microprocessor-based boards is an increasingly important issue, due to their usage in many safety critical systems. To address this issue, the paper describes a software-implemented fault injection system based on the trace exception mode available in most microprocessors. The architecture of the complete fault injection environment is proposed, integrating modules for generating a fault list, for performing their injection and for gathering the results, respectively. Data gathered from some sample benchmark applications are presented The main advantages of the approach are low cost, good portability, and high efficiency.},
